## 🔍 About ip-stresser-ddos

ip-stresser-ddos is a straightforward application designed to test the strength of your network under heavy traffic. It simulates multiple access requests to your server to help you understand how it behaves during high demand. This tool targets Layer 7 (application layer) traffic, often referred to as HTTP floods, to replicate realistic scenarios that a server might face during stress or attack.

While this may sound technical, this guide will walk you through each step, assuming no prior knowledge of networking or programming.

The tool is related to topics like DDoS simulation, HTTP flood testing, and network stability checks. It helps users identify potential weaknesses in web hosting setups or servers by creating controlled stress.

## 📊 Understanding the Results

Interpretation is key to using ip-stresser-ddos effectively.

- **Successful Requests Sent:** Number of requests your system successfully sent.
- **Failed Requests:** Indicates network issues or the target blocking traffic.
- **Response Time:** How fast the target server responded to each request.
- **Errors or Timeouts:** High numbers here may suggest the target is overwhelmed.

Use this information to assess your server’s capability to handle high traffic or potential security weaknesses.
